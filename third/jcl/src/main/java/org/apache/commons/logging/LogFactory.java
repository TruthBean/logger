     * Theoretically, calling getClassLoader can throw a security exception,

     * maximum flexibility. However in practice people don't appear to use
     * security policies that forbid getClassLoader calls. So for the moment
     * all code is written to call this method rather than Class.getClassLoader,

     * disruption later if we need to.
     * <p>
     * Even when using an AccessController, however, this method can still
     * throw SecurityException. Commons-logging basically relies on the
     * ability to access classloaders, ie a policy that forbids all
     * classloader access will also prevent commons-logging from working:
     * currently this method will throw an exception preventing the entire app
     * from starting up. Maybe it would be good to detect this situation and
     * just disable all commons-logging? Not high priority though - as stated
     * above, security policies that prevent classloader access aren't common.
     * <p>
     * Note that returning an object fetched via an AccessController would
     * technically be a security flaw anyway; untrusted code that has access
     * to a trusted JCL library could use it to fetch the classloader for
     * a class even when forbidden to do so directly.

     * <p>
     * The problem is the same one that can occur when loading a concrete Log
     * subclass via a context classloader.
     * <p>
     * The problem occurs when code running in the context classloader calls
     * class X which was loaded via a parent classloader, and class X then calls
     * LogFactory.getFactory (either directly or via LogFactory.getLog). Because
     * class X was loaded via the parent, it binds to LogFactory loaded via
     * the parent. When the code in this method finds some LogFactoryYYYY
     * class in the child (context) classloader, and there also happens to be a
     * LogFactory class defined in the child classloader, then LogFactoryYYYY
     * will be bound to LogFactory@childloader. It cannot be cast to
     * LogFactory@parentloader, ie this method cannot return the object as
     * the desired type. Note that it doesn't matter if the LogFactory class
     * in the child classloader is identical to the LogFactory class in the
     * parent classloader, they are not compatible.
     * <p>
     * The solution taken here is to simply print out an error message when
     * this occurs then throw an exception. The deployer of the application
     * must ensure they remove all occurrences of the LogFactory class from
     * the child classloader in order to resolve the issue. Note that they
     * do not have to move the custom LogFactory subclass; that is ok as
     * long as the only LogFactory class it can find to bind to is in the
